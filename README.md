## About the game

What can I say, it's tic-tac-toe!  The timeless children's game now ready for...well still children but play it anyway!

The game supports custom board sizing up to 21 squares by 21 squares which is a ridiculous way to play it but the option is there if you want it.


## Features to come

* Network gameplay is almost implemented with a full blown chatroom to boot!
* AI opponent that will hopefully not suck but it's tic-tac-toe so how bad can it be?
* More snazzy stuff, animations, sound effects, backgrounds etc
* Firebase authentication because I haven't suffered enough with this thing.


## Known bugs

* Game throws a draw one turn early every second game because apparently roundMod doesn't like to do as it's told
* Need to stop game being playable after winner/draw declared


## Tech used

* Javascript
* jQuery
* CSS
* HTML
* Firebase
